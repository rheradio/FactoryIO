# Teaching Automation with Factory I/O under a Competency-Based Curriculum

Some of the most critical competencies that students need to acquire to become engineers require performing practices under real industrial conditions. Nowadays, there are simulation tools that support recreating such conditions up to a remarkable extent. The low cost and availability of those virtual factories, in terms of time and distance, make them very attractive for university courses. One of these simulation tools is called [FACTORY I/O](https://factoryio.com/).

This repository includes the following material we use to teach control engineering  at the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaiso in Chile:
- **Factory F1: tank liquid level control**.
  - [Simulink model](https://github.com/rheradio/3DFactoySimulationsForControlEngineering/tree/master/Simulink_resources)
  - [FACTORY I/O scene](https://github.com/rheradio/3DFactoySimulationsForControlEngineering/blob/master/FactoryIO_resources/FactoryIO/LevelControl_PID.factoryio)
  - [TIA Portal program for PLC Siemens S7-1200](https://github.com/rheradio/3DFactoySimulationsForControlEngineering/blob/master/FactoryIO_resources/TIA_PORTAL/pid_tank.ap15_1)
- **Factory F2: industrial conveyor belt**.
